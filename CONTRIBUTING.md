## Code Contribution

### Setting up a build environment

Prerequisites:
  - A MacOS or Linux dev machine. 
  - [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/)
  - A Kubernetes cluster (Tested with v1.25+, older versions may work)
    - You can use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to create a local cluster. Follow the [Podman doc page](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/kind/creating-a-kind-cluster) to see how.
  - [Go 1.22](https://go.dev/doc/install)
  - [Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#helm)
  - [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Once you have a cluster to develop on, install the Helm chart to that cluster, as described in the [README](./README.md). Following that, the workflow would look something like this:

  - Make code changes.
  - Run `make docker-all`.
    - This compiles all the code and creates container images for agent, controller and restapi with tag `dev_latest`.
  - Push the latest image to the Kind cluster. Can be done through the Podman desktop UI. [Link to instructions](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/kubernetes/kind/pushing-an-image-to-kind).
  - Restart the relevant pods, so the pod starts with the new image.

Note: The Controller has special commands to make changes to CRD files etc. Please refer to the [controller README](./controller/README.md).

Note 2: The Agent also has special commands to make changes to proto files. Please refer to the [agent README](./agent/README.md).


### Writing new synthetic test plugins for the agent

Synthetic-heart welcomes the community to contribute new plugins for the agents. Please refer to the [agent README](./agent/README.md) to see how to write new plugins.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already reported or fixed by searching through our
[issues list](https://github.com/cisco-open/synthetic-heart/issues).

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as
possible, and, if possible, a test case.

**If you discover a security bug, please do not report it through GitHub. Instead, please see security procedures in
[SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md).**

## Sending Pull Requests

Before sending a new pull request, take a look at existing pull requests and issues to see if the proposed change or fix
has been discussed in the past, or if the change was already implemented but not yet released.

We expect new pull requests to include tests for any affected behavior, and, as we follow semantic versioning, we may
reserve breaking changes until the next major version release.

## Other Ways to Contribute

We welcome anyone that wants to contribute to `synthetic-heart` to triage and reply to open issues to help troubleshoot
and fix existing bugs. Here is what you can do:

- Help ensure that existing issues follows the recommendations from the _[Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues)_ section,
  providing feedback to the issue's author on what might be missing.
- Review existing pull requests, and testing patches against real existing applications that use `synthetic-heart`.
- Write a test, or add a missing test case to an existing test.

Thanks again for your interest on contributing to `synthetic-heart`!
